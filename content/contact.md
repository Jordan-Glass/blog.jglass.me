I haven't added an email address to this site to protect against spam - I can't use email protection services here as this is a static site.

If you'd like to reach out, you can send a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-g-b26288261/) or post a Private Mention on [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@JordanGlass).

A private mention is a post with visibility restricted to only the accounts you mention in the post. You can set the option manually (see the screenshot below), or click "Privately mention @Jordan-Glass" in the menu next to the Follow button on my account. There's a brief explanation in the [Mastodon documentation](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/posting/#direct).

> *Your post should look something like this, but it will omit `@fosstodon.org` if your account is hosted there too.*

*Messages sent via LinkedIn or Mastodon aren't encrypted. If you'd prefer that, let me know when you reach out - emails can be encrypted using my key available on [keys.openpgp.org](https://keys.openpgp.org/). If you don't know what encryption is, that's no problem - it's not required!*
