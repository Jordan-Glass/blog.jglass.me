I'm Jordan Glass, and I'm studying Cyber Security at the [University of Suffolk](https://uos.ac.uk). On this blog you might find posts on:
* Cyber Security
* Urban Design
* Technology

You can find links to my accounts across the Internet in the header above, as well as an [Atom feed](https://blog.jglass.me/atom.xml) to subscribe to. I've also written a blog post detailing how I created this site, from setting up [Zola](https://getzola.org/), to change control with Git, and finally publishing it online - you can read it [here](https://blog.jglass.me/posts/how-i-made-this-blog/).
