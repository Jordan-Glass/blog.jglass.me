# About Me

**I'm Jordan Glass, and I've recently finished studying Cyber Security at the [University of Suffolk](https://uos.ac.uk) having obtained a First Class degree.**

Throughout my study, I've gained experience in Python, Java, MySQL, Cisco IOS and report writing. In programming and software development modules, I implemented GUIs and handled files; in a data analysis module, I made use of [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/); and in a Cyber Forensics module, I used tools to examine a virtual machine, and presented my methodology and findings in an expert witness report. My Dissertation project explored the uses of Open-Source Intelligence.

Outside my studies, I've gained experience in Linux, Git, and simple shell scripting, and I'm interested in motorsport, open-source alternatives to proprietary software, data privacy, self-hosted services, and photography.

I'm now looking to work in an environment with opportunities to learn practical, hands-on skills - both in Cyber Security and IT more widely. My preference is a role in Suffolk, but I'm open to remote and hybrid opportunities further afield too, depending on any commute demands.
