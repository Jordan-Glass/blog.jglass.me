I'm Jordan Glass, and I've recently finished studying Cyber Security at the [University of Suffolk](https://uos.ac.uk) having obtained a First Class degree. I'm now looking to work in an environment with opportunities to learn practical, hands-on skills - both in Cyber Security and IT more widely. My preference is a role in Suffolk, but I'm open to remote and hybrid opportunities further afield too.

On this blog you might find posts on Cyber Security, as well as Urban Design and Technology more widely.

I've also written a blog post detailing how I created this site, from setting up [Zola](https://getzola.org/) to change control with Git - you can read Part 1 [here](/posts/getting-started-with-zola-part-1/).
