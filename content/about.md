I'm Jordan Glass, and I'm studying Cyber Security at the [University of Suffolk](https://uos.ac.uk). On this blog you might find posts on that topic, as well as Urban Design and Technology more widely.

You can find links to my accounts across the Internet in the header above, as well as an [Atom feed](atom.xml) to subscribe to. I've also written a blog post detailing how I created this site, from setting up [Zola](https://getzola.org/) to change control with Git - you can read Part 1 [here](posts/getting-started-with-zola-part-1/).

You can also find a link to this blog's GitHub repository on the [Projects page](projects) linked in the header above.
