# blog.jglass.me

My personal blog site, generated by [Zola](https://getzola.org), styled using the [Apollo](https://github.com/not-matthias/apollo) theme, and deployed using [zola-deploy-action](https://github.com/shalzz/zola-deploy-action/).

The Apollo theme used here has been lightly modified to change and add functionality, including changing how dates are displayed, showing the post authors, and more extensively utilising [OpenGraph](https://ogp.me) tags. Modifications to this theme are included in `/templates`, and you can check the commit history for these files to see what was changed. All changes follow comments beginning `<!-- EXT:`.

A link to the site is included in the repository About panel. You can switch between light and dark themes using the sun and moon icons in the top-right of each page.
