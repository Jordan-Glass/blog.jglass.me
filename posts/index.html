It's created by Facebook, which would normally be a big red flag for me - but since it's an open standard, other sites have embraced it too, including Microsoft's LinkedIn and the decentralised Mastodon.<p>Platforms use OGP data to display rich information alongside webpages their users link to, including photos, bespoke headlines that differ from the page's actual title, and descriptions to elaborate on both of them.<p>Four tags are required as a baseline: …</div><a class=readmore href=https://blog.jglass.me/posts/implementing-ogp/>Read more...</a></div></div></div></section><section class=list-item><div class=post-header><div><h1 class=title><a href=https://blog.jglass.me/posts/implementing-noml/>Implementing NoML in Zola (And Why You Might Want To)</a> </h1><time>28 November 2023</time><div class=meta><div class=description><p>AI is big business, and it's largely fuelled by the vast troves of data on the Internet.

Being a static site, it's simple and doesn't require a database behind it to serve files from - and, in using Markdown, text is formatted in the same way as note-taking apps such as Notion and Obsidian, meaning you don't need to learn HTML syntax to start writing.<p><em>In theory</em> that's simple, but figuring out how to make Zola build a nice-looking, themed site from those Markdown files takes a little more understanding. You might also want to use Git to track the changes you make, and publish the site automatically using a platform like GitHub or Cloudflare Pages.<p>In this post I'll share how I made this blog, from installing Zola, to adding a theme, and building a site you can see in your browser - as well as learning the basics of Git in the process.</p> …</div><a class=readmore href=https://blog.jglass.me/posts/getting-started-with-zola-part-1/>Read more...</a></div></div></div></section></ul></main><ul class=pagination></ul></div>
